# Ready & Raising - the personal fundraising tracking app for Russell Morbey

I've decided to make an app to help me fundraise for a charity half marathon I'm taking part in in May 2026, the idea behind it is so those who have or are thinking of donating towards my fundraising goal have a single place to view my training data as well as my current fundraising amount and goal. This is the front-end portion of my app, I learnt how to use figma and cursor as my IDE using the AI assistant throughout. I used this project as a stepping stone into finding ways to use AI to benifit my work output. This journey was a discovery into the ups and downs of AI development, and how as a developer there are a lot of new skills to learn along the way.
