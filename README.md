# This is the start of my personal fundraising tracking app project.

I've decided to make an app to help me fundraise for a charity half marathon I'm taking part in in May 2026, the idea behind it is so those who have or are thinking of donating towards my fundraising goal have a single place to view my training data, fundraising data as well as a place that myself and the donators can interact. This is the front-end portion of my app, I am planning on learning how to use figma as well as cursor AI to support me in the process of making this app.

## Features in development

- Display total distance traveled in km since starting to fundraise for run.

- Display last few runs data. 5ks, 10ks, 15ks.

- Display current fundraising amount and goal.

- Link to fundraising page.

- Interactive elements. Possibly a race Russell Game with daily/weekly leaderboard. 90's arcade style.

- Encouragement section. (Host side filtering of posts for offensivelanguage/emjois)

- Message shown on app as well as being sent to my device using free sms service.

- Latests donations as well as showing the target of running 1k per Â£1 raised up to a max of 25k weekly.

- Display video, and also the album or playlist for that activity.

## Features that have been implemented

- Work in progress

## Tickets - generally written down on my phones daily task journal of what needs doing next

- Make a frontend repo outlining process, features and tickets.

- Use figma to design what the layout and look of the app is going to be both on browser and mobile.

- Use cursor and figma to make CSS HTML styling for the apps layout.

- Use cursor to build frontend react components.

### Landing page tickets

- overall improve styling

- info of what the goal of the app is and routes to more in depth data on specific features

- route to both game and recent activities

- make sure recent activities shows a general highlight of lasst activity from each column within the recent activities page.

- have a subtitle in the recent activities box saying how many kilometers ran so far while in trainingi for the fundrasier.
  
- have the game box show an image for the game and current high scores.

### Recent activities tickets 

- overall improve styling

- each run data section should be scrollable to show multiple activities.

- each section should contain image/video and comments from Strava, as well as playlist from activity.

### Game tickets

- overall improve styling
  
- change computer to Russell

- change icon to a little gfigure with a Russell face running

- update leader board

- add a screen that confirms if you won or not, and if you wanted to add your score with chosen name to the leader board

- make a try again button to play the game again without having to go back

- add a three second countdown on the screen and a Go! to start the game.

### Fundraising footer tickets

- change the overall styling of it
  
- make the funding bar go all the way across
  
- make the GOSH just giving link using font and styling

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
